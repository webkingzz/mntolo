<h3>Contact form</h3>
<p>Should you send us questions via the contact form, we will collect the data entered on the form, including the contact details you provide, to answer your question and any follow-up questions.</p>
<p>We got 4 kinds of contact forms on our website:</p>
<ol>
<li>Contact forms that send a direct mail to our headquarter</li>
<li><a href="https://kriesi.at/support/pre-sale-question/">Contact forms</a> that generate a pre sale question in <a href="https://kriesi.at/support/forum/pre-sale-questions/">our support forum</a></li>
<li>Contact forms that are used in our Theme Demos, which do not send emails and are just for visual presentation</li>
<li>Newsletter signup forms. These are explained in detail in Section 6 &#8220;Newsletter&#8221; of our privacy policy.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Support Forum contact forms</strong></p>
<p>If you use the contact form for pre sale questions, this will generate a new thread in our support forum that is visible to the general public once a moderator has replied.</p>
<p><strong>Email contact forms</strong></p>
<p>Data and information sent via the other contact forms is not shared without your permission.</p>
<p>We will, therefore, process any data you enter onto the contact form only with your consent per Art. 6 (1)(a) GDPR. You may revoke your consent at any time. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p>
<p>We will retain the data you provide on the contact form until you request its deletion, revoke your consent for its storage, or the purpose for its storage no longer pertains (e.g. after fulfilling your request).

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="av-intro-text">If Enfold were a new theme and we were to release it in 2017, that&#8217;s probably what it would look like</p>
<p>Everything in this release was geared toward the question: If we would release a new theme today, how would it look like and how would it behave? More detailed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Would we build the site with aÂ frontend editor or still use a backend editor?</li>
<li>How would it look like?</li>
<li>Would we need another slew of elements for the builder or are we fine with what we got?</li>
<li>What about the design of existing elements?</li>
<li>Which demos would we need?</li>
</ul>
<p>First of all, I think a lot of the decisions and assumptions on how a theme should work that we made back when we built Enfold are still valid. And I think a lotÂ of our customers agree with us, since Enfold is still the best rated top seller on Themeforest with anÂ <strong>astonishingÂ rating of 4.85 out of 5</strong>. If you think about it, thats quite insane. Our rating gets worse if someone rates the theme with 4 stars; yet 4 stars is already considered an excellent rating :)</p>
<div class='avia-double-buttons av-download-buttons'><a href='https://kriesi.at/themes/enfold-2017/' target='_blank' class='avia-double-button avia-double-button-1'>View Demo</a><span class='button_or'>or</span><a href='https://kriesi.at/themes/enfold-2017/' target='_blank' class='avia-double-button avia-double-button-2'>View Details</a></div>
<p>But there are always things to improve so hereÂ here are a few explanations, thoughts and conclusions for those questions above, and what we plan to do in the future:</p>
<p><span id="more-3397"></span></p>
<h3>#1) The Editor</h3>
<p>These days one of the core experiences to improve is the way a website gets built. So the first question weÂ asked ourselves was if a frontend editor should replace (or be added) to the backendÂ advanced layout editor that we currently use.</p>
<p>There are a lot of meritsÂ for that argument, and the most noticeable one was that you can see how an element looks like while you are editing it. This is especially beneficial if you take new users into account, who have little or no idea how a certain element will look like if they change an option or setting.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we consider lay-outing a site with front-end editors a pain. We have not seen an approach by anyone yet which works as fine as the visual dumbed down version of a backend editor.Â Even with several prototypes built by ourselves, there was no way we could reproduce the super simple andÂ clear process of building a layout in your backend.</p>
<p>So we decided to <strong>marry the best features of both worlds</strong> and heavily improved our backend editor with a lot more visual cues for layout elements like sections, grids and columns (which now display their backend color, their id, their background image and more&#8230;)</p>
<p>More importantly we also added a <a href="https://kriesi.at/themes/enfold-2017/files/2017/02/layout_editor.jpg">live preview window</a> toÂ most of the content elements, which allows us to show to users how their changes visually affect an element without the need to switch to the frontend.</p>
<p><a href="https://kriesi.at/themes/enfold-2017/files/2017/02/layout_editor.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3423 size-full" src="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/preview.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="400" srcset="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/preview.jpg 800w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/preview-300x150.jpg 300w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/preview-768x384.jpg 768w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/preview-705x353.jpg 705w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/preview-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p>I built the whole <a href="https://kriesi.at/themes/enfold-2017/">Enfold 2017 Demo</a> with these features already implemented and really loved the experience, so I am very curious about your feedback :)</p>
<h3>#2)Â Design and availability of layout builder elements</h3>
<p>In general we don&#8217;t think that there are a lot of elements that would beÂ totally necessary to add to the theme. We already got about 70 different ones (also counting the ones that are only activated when plugins like WooCommerce are active) and <a href="https://kriesi.at/themes/enfold-overview/">our demos</a> show that you can build pretty much everything you can think off.</p>
<p><strong>BUT</strong>:Â every now and then we encounter something nice on other websites or get feature requests that make total sense at the time and then decide to add that element. I still like that approach and I think we will keepÂ doing that in the future. This was also the case with the latest element that got added, the <a href="https://kriesi.at/themes/enfold-2017/elements/tab-section/">tab section</a>.</p>
<p>Customers have requested a tab element that can take full advantage of the layout builder for a while now, but since it required a lot of rewriting of the way the builder works in the backend, we postponed it time and time again. However with the latest release and with the extensive rewrites to the layout builder that we already did, the time for this element has finally come :)</p>
<p>In addition to that, now that we got a visual preview Â for content elements, its also a lot easier for us to add more design options without overwhelming newer customers. The first few elements that received more styles to chose from are the <a href="https://kriesi.at/themes/enfold-2017/elements/progress-bars/">progress bar</a>, the <a href="https://kriesi.at/themes/enfold-2017/elements/testimonials/">testimonial element</a> and the <a href="https://kriesi.at/themes/enfold-2017/elements/icon-box/">icon box</a> but others will soon follow.</p>
<p>We also tried to streamline a lot of the design elements on our pages among all elements (e.g.: the loader that is visible once you click a light-box image, a portfolio Ajax item, a masonry load more button etc. was modernized and streamlined across all elements and also improved for retina display)</p>
<p>This is the way we intend to go forward in the future as well. Be careful with adding new elements, be careful with adding new theme options that don&#8217;t offer visual feedback, but try to add more options for elements that work with the preview window; and on top of that make sure that all of this stuff fits together well and then pack it into new amazing demos. Speaking of demos&#8230;</p>
<h3>#3) The Main Demo</h3>
<p><a href="https://kriesi.at/themes/enfold-2017/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3422 size-full" src="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2017.jpg" width="800" height="400" srcset="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2017.jpg 800w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2017-300x150.jpg 300w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2017-768x384.jpg 768w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2017-705x353.jpg 705w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2017-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p>Another question to be asked when you release a new theme: How should the main demo look like?</p>
<p>We still like the Classic Enfold Demo that was released 4 years ago, but there are certain elements and design choices that look a little dated by now. They are still beloved by a lot of users, thats why we did not simply change existing elements, butÂ as mentioned above, added additional style now that we got the preview window.</p>
<p>But in order to take full advantage of all the stuff that we built during the last 4 years we decided that we need a new main demo. This always takes a lot of effort, since other than the usual niche demo which seldomÂ has more than 5-10 pages, theseÂ full feature demos have several hundred individual pages. We are really happy with the outcome andÂ <a href="https://kriesi.at/themes/enfold-2017/">hope you like it as well!</a></p>
<p>The old main demo will of course still stay online and be available for demo import in the future.</p>
<h3>And whats next?</h3>
<p>Next thing on our agenda is to improve all the elements that could benefit from an overhaul on mobile devices. We have snuck a few things into this release already but will try to heavily improve the mobile experience with the next one. Feel free to leave any suggestions in the comment section of this post.</p>
<p>Last but not least we got the usual change log with a list of bug fixes and improvements.</p>
<p><a href="https://themeforest.net/item/enfold-responsive-multipurpose-theme/4519990#item-description__changelog">Here are the</a> most important changes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="av-intro-text">Learn how to use WordPress to build interactive prototypes for your future clientsÂ </p>
<p>With every new client relationship comes the unknown element of just how technologically savvy they are. Even in cases of average capability, static wire framing can be a tedious process where clients misinterpret how the final product will work or lose interest in the project as it was proposed altogether.</p>
<p>A potential solution to this problem is rapid prototyping, which enables you to present the client with an interactive experience they understand while increasing their excitement about the end result <em>and</em> cultivating actionable feedback.Â WordPress makes rapid prototyping (relatively) easy, so much so that you canÂ even use it as a marketing tool when pitching your work to potential customers.</p>
<p>In this postÂ we&#8217;re going to exploreÂ the essentials for creating a rapid prototype with WordPress. By the time we&#8217;re done, you&#8217;ll be able to start rapid prototyping in WordPress for your clients!<span id="more-3179"></span></p>
<h2>What Is Rapid Prototyping?</h2>
<p>Simply put, a rapid prototype is an early interactive demo of a product thatÂ helps bridge the gap between concept and execution.</p>
<div id="attachment_3224" style="width: 1040px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-3224" src="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/wordpress-rapid-prototype.png" alt="A WordPress rapid prototype" width="1030" height="635" srcset="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/wordpress-rapid-prototype.png 1030w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/wordpress-rapid-prototype-300x185.png 300w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/wordpress-rapid-prototype-705x435.png 705w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/wordpress-rapid-prototype-450x277.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Rapid prototypes can be as simple as this.</p></div>
<p>The critical factor when deciding to use a rapid prototype is that it is indeed executed rapidly. Used effectively, it helps reduce confusion with the client, provides for intermediate UX testing, and ultimately cuts down on the time it takes to build the final product. Used ineffectively, it can add too much bloat or additional effort to be worthwhile.</p>
<p>If you find yourself submitting work that was originally approved by a client based on static wireframes only to have them reject it because it wasnât what they expected, rapid prototyping may be for you.</p>
<p>WordPress makes rapid prototyping particularly easy. Due to its built-in functionality and automatic theming, you can provide a playground for your client to experiment with while you work out the more complex details for the end product. If your prototype winds up with elements you love, WordPress offers great import and export options that make it easy to transfer your work to the final version.</p>
<p>Rapid prototyping sellsÂ clients on yourÂ work because they can actually interact with it. This builds excitement for the project and trains the client to give you the right kind of feedback to move the project forward.</p>
<p>Once youâve gotten the hang of rapid prototyping, you can use it in several ways: impressing your customers with something that works right away, getting relevant feedback for projects, and quickly building demos as a selling point for potential clients.</p>
<p>But, before you can use these advantages, you have to know how to createÂ rapid prototypes!</p>
<h2>Step #1: Set Up WordPress for Rapid Prototyping</h2>
<p>There are two primary ways for you to run rapid prototypes with WordPress.</p>
<ol>
<li>A single <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network" target="_blank">multisite</a> operating all future prototypes.</li>
<li>A new WordPress installation per demo.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unless you run highly customized apps withÂ the WordPress platform, you probablyÂ use the same group of your favorite plugins for every project you work on. This makes multisite veryÂ effective, since you only install your plugins and themes once for them to be available on the rest of your sites. Additionally, you donât have to track multiple installations scattered over endless domains and subdomains.</p>
<p>If you run unique WordPress applications, you shouldÂ run independent installations for every demo.</p>
<h3>Prototypes Are Not Unique</h3>
<p>Rapid prototyping itself is not complicated.</p>
<p>That doesnât stop us, as developers, from making it complicated and destroying the whole mission of the prototype in the first place.</p>
<p>But donât lose hope! Every time you create a prototype, youâll get a little faster at it. The idea is to keep things pre-packaged, organized, and collected so that you have a complete site up and running with the least effort possible.</p>
<p>If youâre not running multisite, make sure you keep local copies of your favorite plugins and themes to upload at a moment&#8217;s notice.</p>
<p>Remember: prototypes are about blocked out areas, workflows, and how content works together. Donât concern yourself with specific design or functionality.</p>
<p>In other words, donât spend a lot of time creating a unique prototype. That goes against the point of rapid prototype altogether.</p>
<h3>Generating a Prototype</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3193" src="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/enfold-demos.png" alt="Importable Demos for Rapid Prototyping" width="749" height="514" srcset="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/enfold-demos.png 1073w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/enfold-demos-300x206.png 300w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/enfold-demos-1030x707.png 1030w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/enfold-demos-705x484.png 705w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/enfold-demos-450x309.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" /></p>
<p>You can generate prototypes the easy way or the hard way.</p>
<p>The hard method is to go entirely custom. You can create example demos, export the settings, and hope that youâve predicted every scenario youâll need for the future. When itâs time to create the prototype, youâll import those settings and setup a new child theme for customizations.</p>
<p>This method is a bit slower, as it requires you to keep your presets up to date while coding endless child themes.</p>
<p>The easy method is to use one theme that generates websites for you, based on demos that come bundled with that theme. This route is optimal as it not only provides built-in placeholder content, but also preset styles that change depending on your needs. You get twice the results for half theÂ effort.</p>
<p>Our own theme, Enfold, <a href="https://kriesi.at/themedemo/?theme=enfold-overview" target="_blank">is a great example of this</a>. It comes with 16 different easy start demos that can be imported in a few seconds. Even if you donât find that Enfold is the theme for you, make sure to look for this sort of capability in the theme you choose for your rapid prototypes.</p>
<h2>Step #2: Choose Existing Products for Faster Prototyping</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3201" src="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/wordpress-plugins.png" alt="Finding WordPress plugins" width="751" height="238" srcset="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/wordpress-plugins.png 1006w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/wordpress-plugins-300x95.png 300w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/wordpress-plugins-705x224.png 705w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/wordpress-plugins-450x143.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px" /></p>
<p>WordPress is such a powerful option for rapid prototyping because of how many quick-fix products already exist.</p>
<p>You can leverage these as placeholders within the prototype while you work on the perfect solution to use on the final version of your project. Whether you are building e-commerce stores, social networks, forums, or simply adding advanced blogging features, find something fast and easy to hold its place.</p>
<p>If youâve gone multisite, your collection of plugins and themes will only grow. If youâre running independent WordPress installations, make sure to keep the plugins and themes you use together for easy access on the next project.</p>
<h3>How to Choose the Right Plugins</h3>
<p>Rapid development means you can add, move, and replace anything, anywhere on your prototype without hassle.</p>
<p>The goal here is to find plugins that make this possible. In other words, you want shortcode- and widget-enabled plugins.Â These features allowÂ you to avoid coding plugin hooks into your theme. (Because custom coding simply isn&#8217;t rapid.)</p>
<h3>How to Choose the Right Themes</h3>
<p>Keep the same principles in mind when you choose a theme. Look for modularized areas that allow you to move and reorganize individual sections at a moment&#8217;s notice.</p>
<p>There are two ways a theme can make generating your prototype insanely simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Importable demos (child themes coming in as a second alternative).</li>
<li>Drag-and-drop interfaces for quick page manipulation.</li>
</ol>
<p>You should be able to go from âHello World!â to something relatively functional in a matter of minutes. It needs to be fast to make it worth the effort.</p>
<p>(We canât help but point out that we offer both of these features in the <a href="https://kriesi.at/themedemo/?theme=enfold-overview" target="_blank">Enfold theme</a>.Â Itâs really that easy.)</p>
<h2>Skill #3: Know How Deep to Go With Your Prototype</h2>
<p>Now that you can set up a default prototype in under 15 minutes, how do you know when to stop customizing the prototype? Your effort stops being worth it if you spend too long on the prototype without ever moving on to the final version of the project.</p>
<p>The answer is almost too simple: create the most basic version possible.Â To know just how basic that is, identify what kind of site it is with the following guidelines. They are pretty straightforward.</p>
<h3>1. Content-Based Websites Focus More on Design Elements</h3>
<p>Content-based websites will focus more on the layout of sections, calls to action, potential design elements, the look-and-feel, and how all the static pages work together.</p>
<p>Functionality plays a lesser role here. For example, donât get stuck on your client being able to test out features for logging in.</p>
<h3>2. Interactive Sites Focus More on Functionality</h3>
<p>Running a complex site with back end interfaces that will actually be used requires a bit more attention to those workflows. For example, if the site will be running a forum or e-commerce solution, itâs important to test that user experience with real functionality.</p>
<p>Existing plugins save the day here by taking all that work and turning it into something manageable.</p>
<p>You can test out relatively complex scenarios on your prototype with the installation of a few existing plugins.</p>
<h3>Keep the Focus Clear With the Client</h3>
<p>While rapid prototyping is not entirely new, thereâs always a good chance your client has never dealt with itÂ before.</p>
<p>Before handing a prototype over to your client and expecting them to know what to do with it, youâll want to be sure toÂ outline what the focus of theÂ prototype is.Â Whether it isÂ design elements toÂ be refined, orÂ onlyÂ the cohesive workflow â be sure to clarify that this is not the final product, but a demo toÂ test particular elements of their project.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, WordPress makes it incredibly simple to get the right kind of feedback.</p>
<h2>Skill #4: GetÂ Better Feedback From Your Client</h2>
<p>WordPress offers a variety of features to make it easy on your client to provide relevant feedback within the rapid prototype.</p>
<h3>Wrangle Client Questions With Documentation</h3>
<p>Is your client constantly forgetting certain elements of the project to keep in mind while reviewing the prototype?</p>
<p>Use WordPress to create documentation on the prototypeÂ itself to help answer questions as your client invents them. Make this as simple, or as complicated as the situation calls for.</p>
<p>You can even take this so far as to include tooltips or inline commenting for on-the-go documentation.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3220" src="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/simple-tooltips.png" alt="Simple Tooltips plugin logo" width="1540" height="496" srcset="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/simple-tooltips.png 1540w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/simple-tooltips-300x97.png 300w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/simple-tooltips-1030x332.png 1030w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/simple-tooltips-1500x483.png 1500w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/simple-tooltips-705x227.png 705w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/simple-tooltips-450x145.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 1540px) 100vw, 1540px" /></p>
<p>Try it with <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-tooltips/" target="_blank">WordPress Tooltips</a>Â or <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-tooltips/" target="_blank">Simple Tooltips</a>.</p>
<h3>Use the Built-in Commenting System</h3>
<p>For pages, posts, and custom post types, take advantage of the commenting system included automatically. No plugins needed here!</p>
<p>Show your clients where the comment form is, and ask them to leave their feedback there.</p>
<h3>In-line Commenting for Content Driven Pages</h3>
<p>Are you setting up a landing page that relies primarily on written copy and client-provided imagery?</p>
<p>Though new to the field, there are WordPress plugins available â such as <a href="https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/inline-comments/" target="_blank">Inline Comments</a> â that enable you to comment at a paragraph level within posts and pages. Using such a solution may be the most practical way for you to collaborate with your client.</p>
<h3>Customizable Contact Forms</h3>
<p>If the built-in comment forms and in-line commenting options arenât working for you, build your own forms asking the client for exactly what you need.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/" target="_blank">Contact Form 7</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninja-forms/" target="_blank">Ninja Forms</a> are both great plugins that makes this process easy.</p>
<div id="attachment_3221" style="width: 1550px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-3221" src="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ninja-forms.png" alt="Plus Ninja Forms has sweet branding." width="1540" height="496" srcset="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ninja-forms.png 1540w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ninja-forms-300x97.png 300w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ninja-forms-1030x332.png 1030w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ninja-forms-1500x483.png 1500w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ninja-forms-705x227.png 705w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ninja-forms-450x145.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 1540px) 100vw, 1540px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Plus Ninja Forms has sweet branding.</p></div>
<p>Once you build your form with questions like, &#8220;Which element of the site broke?&#8221; and &#8220;What error occurred?&#8221;, add it to a page that your client can easily reference.</p>
<p>This may help for particularly problematic clients who tend to go off topic or donât actually answer your questions. By giving them a step by step form to fill out, youâll finally get the answers you were looking for.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It can be difficult to manage client expectations for what a website project can achieve, but prototyping can help eliminate these miscommunications and reduce dissatisfaction once the final product has been built.</p>
<p>Your next step is to decide: are rapid prototypes worth the effort for your line of work? Donât write it off until you give it a shot. Set up that multisite network and try it out. Determine how far your prototype should go based on your project. Generate a demo site and tweak it.</p>
<p>Once you get started, it only gets easier with time. Before long, youâll find yourself throwing up a rapid prototype to sell your ideas to potential customers. Youâll be winning with your existing clients, and win over brand new ones with minimal effort.</p>
<p>Will you be using prototypes for your clients in the future?Â Tell us what you think in the comments!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="av-intro-text">A few lessons you will be able to learn from this great bookÂ </p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re a designer, developer, business owner â or mixture of all three in the case of theme developers â the way you go about your business will almost certainly have altered dramatically over the last number of years.</p>
<p>Trying to keep pace with the rate of change in WordPress and beyond can often feel like a full-time job in itself â witness the looming challenge of the <a href="http://wp-api.org/" target="_blank">WordPress REST API</a> for example.</p>
<p>One of the best ways of staying ahead of the curve is by examining the unorthodox success strategies of this generation&#8217;s new wave of billion dollar businesses. At the top of that particular tree in the WordPress world is, of course,Â <a href="http://automattic.com/" target="_blank">Automattic</a>.<span id="more-2718"></span></p>
<p>In this article we&#8217;ll look at six takeaways for theme developers from <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Year-Without-Pants-WordPress-com/dp/1118660633" target="_blank">The Year Without Pants</a></em> â the most in-depth, insider account of Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s company to date.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with some background.</p>
<h2>What is the Year Without Pants?</h2>
<p><em>The Year Without Pants: WordPress.com and the future of work</em> is an account of author <a href="http://scottberkun.com/" target="_blank">Scott Berkun</a>&#8216;s time spent working as a team leader at Automattic from 2010 to 2012. And what better way to introduce the book than by its own ad?</p>
<div class='avia-iframe-wrap'><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jjv2fm7CMgE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>His 2013 book â which has garnered <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/the-year-without/9781118728956/9781118728956ffirs.xhtml" target="_blank">consistent praise</a> since its release â is a backstage look at a company which has <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3025191/leadership-now/automattics-unorthodox-view-on-productivity-tracks-output-not-appearance" target="_blank">attracted attention</a> for its often unorthodox approach to the nature of modern work.</p>
<p>Berkun <a href="http://scottberkun.com/2010/news-i-have-a-new-job-automattic/" target="_blank">came on board</a> as employee #58 at an interesting time for the company. At this time they were transitioning from a small, freewheeling team with no strict hierarchies, to a larger and more structured organization responsible for delivering value to millions of users.</p>
<p>Though hired as a team lead, Berkun is also an accomplished author and speaker â as seen in his Google talk on the book below â with a <a href="http://scottberkun.com/essays/41-why-i-left-microsoft/" target="_blank">long stint in various roles</a> at Microsoft under his belt prior to joining Automattic.</p>
<div class='avia-iframe-wrap'><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wlLe_jQdTkA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p><em>The Year Without Pants</em> is both an account of Burken&#8217;s time working at Automattic and a fascinating insight into the changing nature of modern work, as seen through the eyes of an informed and deeply embedded observer.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re involved with WordPress in any professional capacity at all, it&#8217;s a fascinating peek behind the scenes of the biggest beast in the WordPress jungle. Furthermore, it&#8217;s packed full of actionable insights for theme developers in particular.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at some of the major takeaways from the book.</p>
<h2>1. Remote Working Is the New Reality</h2>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-2731" src="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Year-without-Pants-cover-1.png" alt="Year without Pants cover" width="400" height="600" srcset="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Year-without-Pants-cover-1.png 900w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Year-without-Pants-cover-1-200x300.png 200w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Year-without-Pants-cover-1-687x1030.png 687w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Year-without-Pants-cover-1-470x705.png 470w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Year-without-Pants-cover-1-450x675.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" />Automattic has been a globally distributed company from its inception and â though they now boast <a href="http://automattic.com/lounge/" target="_blank">modern headquarters</a> in San Francisco â the majority of its workers are still operating remotely.</p>
<p>One of the fascinating things about Berkun&#8217;s book is watching how this arrangement actually works in the context of the biggest WordPress project on earth.</p>
<p>Two things soon become clear as the book unfolds:</p>
<ol>
<li>There really is no majorÂ obstacle to running a company of significant size remotely.</li>
<li>Real world meetups still matter.</li>
</ol>
<p>Though juggling timezones and disparate remote schedules in his role as team lead is new to Berkun, the sheer amount of actual work covered by him and his team is testament to the fact that the setup fundamentally works.</p>
<p>It may just be a manifestation of Burken&#8217;s background in more formal structures at Microsoft, but the importance of occasional real world meet-ups also shines through. Whether this is through the annual company meeting or the Athens team meetup â the first in Automattic&#8217;s history â that opens the book.</p>
<p>Theme developers worldwide can take inspiration from several aspects of the real world remote working environment that Berkun maps out for us. The author doesn&#8217;t shrink from describing negative aspects, and â whether concerning the availability of a global talent pool, approaches to geographically dispersed project communication or tips on management â there is a lot here to ponder.</p>
<h2>2. You Have to Ship</h2>
<p>Another key takeaway from the book is the value of shipping early and shipping often, ably illustrated by the sheer volume of releases prior to and during Berkun&#8217;s time at the company:</p>
<blockquote><p>By the time I was hired in August 2010, there had been twenty-five thousand releases of WordPress.com, and there would be over fifty thousand by the time I left in 2012.</p>
<p>â <em>Chapter 11, Real Artists Ship</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Automattic&#8217;s success in delivering this rate of change is in large part due to the quality of their team. However the book also emphasizes their commitment to no-nonsense feature planning, and the best of modern development practices tie into this.</p>
<p>Features are deliberately limited in scope and the various teams strive to avoid getting sucked into long, drawn out &#8220;big&#8221; releases. Instead they choose to constantly push small changes out the door while closely monitoring their impact and performance.</p>
<p>As the book makes clear, this culture of constantly shipping is built upon a <a href="http://toni.org/2010/05/19/in-praise-of-continuous-deployment-the-wordpress-com-story/" target="_blank">technical architecture of continuous deployment</a> with the ability to release â and possibly roll back â multiple features on a daily basis.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a system that has been adopted by several other notable online heavyweights such as <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/case-continuous-delivery" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2014/03/etsy-deploy-50-times-a-day" target="_blank">Etsy</a>, and is a fascinatingly iterative approach to product development that is genuinely new.</p>
<p>A headfirst leap into continuous deployment may be a bridge too far for many theme developers, but there is much to be learned from the agile attitude, commitment to micro-release schedules and focus on feedback monitoringÂ that Berkun describes.</p>
<h2>3. Hiring Has to Be Re-Imagined</h2>
<p>Another area where Automattic has attracted attention over the years is hiring, and Berkun&#8217;s account of his own initial on-boarding at the company offers an excellent illustration of their overall approach.</p>
<p>Real-world trial projects â what Mullenweg refers to as <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/01/hire-by-auditions-not-resumes/" target="_blank">hiring by audition</a> â are heavily favored over abstract technical interviews or <a href="http://www.mytechinterviews.com/10-famous-microsoft-interview-puzzles" target="_blank">stunt questions</a>;Â a strategy quite at odds with that of other tech giants such as Microsoft or Google.</p>
<p>All new hires are also forced to complete a stint in <a href="http://automattic.com/work-with-us/happiness-engineer/" target="_blank">customer support</a> to learn the ropes which, while hardly a revolutionary approach, is an eminently sensible way of drilling the importance of the end-user experience into new hires.</p>
<p>Automattic&#8217;s extraordinary success in building a <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2014/05/05/automattic-valued-at-1-16-billion-says-it-doesnt-need-ipo/" target="_blank">billion dollar business</a> with a comparatively tiny headcount leading to <a href="http://www.tinethygesen.com/post/45731400338/how-much-revenue-do-the-big-boys-make-stats-on" target="_blank">outsize revenue per employee figures</a> shows the difference this type of approach to hiring can make.</p>
<p>The main takeaway for theme developers â especially when hiring remotely â is clear: real world delivery trumps paper qualifications and claimed areas of expertise every time.</p>
<h2>4. The World Still Turns Without Email</h2>
<p>One of the more remarkable insights that emerges throughout the book is that communication across a globally distributed team â responsible for satisfying millions of active users â can be managed almost entirely without email.</p>
<p>Burken breaks down internal communication at Automattic during his time as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Blogs (P2): 75%</li>
<li>IRC: 14%</li>
<li>Skype: 5%</li>
<li>Email: 1%</li>
</ol>
<p>Automattic have since added <a href="https://slack.com" target="_blank">Slack</a> somewhat <a href="http://automattic.com/work-with-us/" target="_blank">into the mix</a>, but it&#8217;s a set of figures that would still raise eyebrows at many companies.Â After a somewhat rocky start however, it seems to be one that both the author and his coworkers are incredibly productive with.</p>
<p>A question many theme developers may be pondering after reading the book is whether they can follow the lead of the largest commercial company in their space, and look to minimize the use of email in their own businesses.</p>
<h2>5. It Doesn&#8217;t Have to Be Complicated</h2>
<p>A commitment to not over-complicating matters is on display throughout the book, but two simple lists leaped out in particular, both showcasing the incredible power of keeping things simple.</p>
<p>The first is Burken&#8217;s summary of Automattic&#8217;s general project workflow in the chapter entitled <em>The Bazaar at the Cathedral</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick a problem.</li>
<li>Write a launch announcement and a support page.</li>
<li>Consider what data will tell you that it works.</li>
<li>Get to work.</li>
<li>Launch.</li>
<li>Learn.</li>
<li>Repeat.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a near universally applicable set of steps for any business process, it&#8217;s hard to beat.</p>
<p>The second is from then-CEO <a href="http://toni.org/" target="_blank">Toni Schneider</a>&#8216;s description of management&#8217;s role in the company:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hire great people.</li>
<li>Set good priorities.</li>
<li>Remove distractions.</li>
<li>Get out of the way.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, it&#8217;s a set of clear, actionable guidelines explained with a minimum of fuss.</p>
<p>As most of our readers will know, theme development â and indeed working with WordPress in general â can be a complicated, multi-disciplinary business at times.</p>
<p>One of the huge plus points of the book is the amount of practical, clearly stated guidelines and tips for keeping things simple that pop up throughout.</p>
<h2>6. Money Isnât Everything</h2>
<p>Based largely on the <a href="http://royal.pingdom.com/2012/08/10/traffic-wordpress-com-blog-platform-2006-2015/" target="_blank">consistently stellar growth statistics</a> of WordPress.com over the years, Automattic has attracted several rounds of <a href="http://time.com/88025/wordpress-parent-automattic-joins-the-billion-dollar-club/" target="_blank">significant funding</a> since its incorporation. It has also apparently been largely free from pressing daily financial concerns during its life to date.</p>
<p>The company claims to be <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120425/automattic-grows-up-the-company-behind-wordpress-com-shares-revenue-numbers-and-hires-execs/" target="_blank">profitable since 2012</a> but what Berkun&#8217;s book makes clear â particularly in the chapter <em>Show Me the Money</em> â is that profit is not the driving short-term motive at the company.</p>
<p>The focus instead seems to be consistently on culture, product development, user experience and the company&#8217;s stated aim of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2013/sep/03/democratise-publishing-matt-mullenwegg-cloud" target="_blank">democratizing publishing</a>.</p>
<p>While the average theme developer may not be afforded the luxury of venture capital funding anytime in the near future, there is much to be learned from the idea of concentrating on long-term, user-focused growth and not betting the farm exclusively on the pursuit of short-term profits.</p>
<h2>Bonus: Further Insider Stories to Learn From</h2>
<p><em>The Year Without Pants</em> has insights worth pondering in every chapter but it&#8217;s far from the only business book worth adding to your reading list.</p>
<p>Here are two more insider accounts that make great reading companions to Berkun&#8217;s book:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em><a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/" target="_blank">Getting Real</a></em> from the <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/" target="_blank">team behind Basecamp</a>:</strong> Though billed as a guide to building web applications more effectively, this (free) eBook also functions as an insider guide to many modern work practices and dovetails nicely with themes explored in Berkun&#8217;s book. Follow-up titles <a href="https://37signals.com/rework/" target="_blank">Rework</a> and <a href="http://37signals.com/remote/" target="_blank">Remote</a> are also recommended.</li>
<li><strong><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591846609" target="_blank">The Smartest Guys in the Room</a> </em>by Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind:</strong> One to be filed under cautionary tales, this searing account of the fall of Enron shows the critical importance of culture and core values in companies of any size.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><em>The Year Without Pants</em> is highly recommended for anybody in the WordPress space.</p>
<p>The engagingly written tour through a year in the life of WordPress&#8217; largest commercial entity is consistently insightful and â while the six points we&#8217;ve highlighted are general â you&#8217;ll find specific takeaways as a theme developer scattered through every chapter.</p>
<p><strong>We&#8217;d love to know if you&#8217;ve picked up a copy of the book yet, or if you have any other titles you&#8217;d recommend to fellow WordPress professionals.Â Get in touch in the comments below and share your thoughts.</strong></p>

<p>As we&#8217;re all painfully aware, web design in general â and WordPress theme development in particular â is exceptionally detail-orientated work.</p>
<p>And, like any calling that requires focus on the minutiae of things, it can be tricky finding time to step back and look at wider trends in your own industry and beyond.</p>
<p>This is particularly true when it comes to a multi-disciplinary tool such as WordPress.Â The pace of change isÂ relentless, and brand new approaches, technologies and trends seem to spring to life from multiple sources every other week.<span id="more-2771"></span></p>
<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll take a look at some of the more notable 2015 web design trends in WordPress and beyond, with a view to giving you context and inspiration for both your own sites and client work.</p>
<p>Before we start examining this year&#8217;s trends in detail though, let&#8217;s take a quick trip down memory lane.</p>
<h2>How We Got Here</h2>
<p>In terms of design and usability, WordPress and the wider web have come a long way in the last twelve years.</p>
<p>The horrors of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_meat_navigation" target="_blank">mystery meat</a>Â navigation, Flash intros and wanton drop shadow abuse are largely in the past. Web design as a <a href="http://www.lynda.com/articles/nope-web-design-isnt-dead" target="_blank">vibrant design discipline</a> has never been in better shape.</p>
<p>The last few years have been dominated by a number of overarching trends which have continued on into 2015. Chief among them are the <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/graphic-design/what-flat-design-3132112" target="_blank">flat design</a>Â movement and a heavy focus on <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/layouts/rwd-fundamentals/index?hl=en" target="_blank">responsive design</a>.Â Specific recent trends from 2013/2014, such as <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/rise-ghost-button/" target="_blank">ghost buttons</a> andÂ <a href="http://info.quintainmarketing.com/blog/7-websites-with-engaging-full-width-image-headers" target="_blank">full-width image headers</a>, have also largely stayed the course.</p>
<p>Advances in browser and device standards are driving increasingly confident approaches to the use of imagery and typography, picking up on decades â and in some cases <a href="http://webtypography.net/" target="_blank">centuries</a> â of best practices in print design.</p>
<p>Overall, theÂ feel of 2015 so far has been one of consolidation and iterative improvement, rather than the adoption of revolutionary new approaches.</p>
<h2>The Sea That WordPress Swims In</h2>
<p>Things have been <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-2-powell-is-now-available-for-download" target="_blank">relatively quiet</a> on the design front in WordPress core so far in 2015, with backstage features such as the <a href="http://wptavern.com/menu-customizer-officially-approved-for-merge-into-wordpress-4-3" target="_blank">Menu Customizer</a> attracting most of the headlines. However, the looming integration of the REST API into core could have significant design implications down the line. We&#8217;ll touch more on that later in the article.</p>
<p>Moving slightly further afield, 2015 has seen the emergence of truly heavyweight competition to WordPress in the CMS and web publishing spaces.</p>
<div id="attachment_2791" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-2791" src="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/squarespace-homepage.png" alt="Squarespace Homepage" width="800" height="347" srcset="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/squarespace-homepage.png 1117w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/squarespace-homepage-300x130.png 300w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/squarespace-homepage-1030x446.png 1030w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/squarespace-homepage-705x305.png 705w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/squarespace-homepage-450x195.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Design-orientedÂ competition is hotting up.</p></div>
<p>Well-funded competitors such as <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/" target="_blank">Squarespace</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/" target="_blank">Medium</a>,Â along with interesting projects such as <a href="https://ghost.org/" target="_blank">Ghost</a>,Â are providing genuine alternatives for people.</p>
<p>Design features have been a key selling point of all these platforms, and their emergence has given WordPress core developers, and the theming community, some long overdue food for thought. In 2015, default design quality is very much a key market differentiator.</p>
<p>Another huge design influence is the dominant role of apps in the digital world. <a href="http://www.smartinsights.com/mobile-marketing/app-marketing/82-of-mobile-media-time-is-via-apps/" target="_blank">82% of mobile media time</a> is now consumed by apps. The <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/netmag/how-web-design-and-mobile-design-are-becoming-same-thing-81412610" target="_blank">knock-on effect on web design</a> has been enormous, and a renewed focus on simplicity of purpose and presentation is making itself felt across the board.</p>
<p>With those general points in mind, let&#8217;s examineÂ the major themes of the year so far in a little more detail.</p>
<h2>Responsive Is Mandatory</h2>
<p>The jury on this one is very much in. The <a href="http://www.smartinsights.com/mobile-marketing/mobile-marketing-analytics/mobile-marketing-statistics/" target="_blank">mobile tipping point</a>Â has long since passed and there&#8217;s no putting the toothpaste back in the tube â online design in 2015 means responsive design.</p>
<p>For any designers or developers still swimming against the tide, Google&#8217;s recent announcement of penalties for non-responsive websites â the so-called <a href="http://searchengineland.com/mobilegeddon-beginning-not-ending-220512" target="_blank">Mobilegeddon</a> â should be enough to drive the point home.</p>
<div id="attachment_2773" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-2773" src="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/guardian-redesign.png" alt="Guardian redesign" width="800" height="480" srcset="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/guardian-redesign.png 1065w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/guardian-redesign-300x180.png 300w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/guardian-redesign-1030x618.png 1030w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/guardian-redesign-705x423.png 705w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/guardian-redesign-450x270.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Guardian&#8217;s 2015 responsive redesign.</p></div>
<p>The Guardian&#8217;s <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/help/insideguardian/2015/jan/28/welcome-to-the-new-guardian-website" target="_blank">long-awaited responsive overhaul</a>Â was just one in a series of <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/netmag/top-ten-website-redesigns-61515334" target="_blank">high-profile, mobile-orientated redesigns</a> of major sites taking place in 2015.</p>
<div id="attachment_2804" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-2804 size-full" src="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/bbc-responsive1.jpg" alt="bbc-responsive" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/bbc-responsive1.jpg 800w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/bbc-responsive1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/bbc-responsive1-705x470.jpg 705w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/bbc-responsive1-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The BBC&#8217;s new responsive site</p></div>
<p>Following a year of testing, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/" target="_blank">the BBC</a> also flicked the final switch on its own <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-31966686" target="_blank">responsive reboot</a> in early 2015.Â Even the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/" target="_blank">White House</a> has started <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/04/09/whitehousegov-evolving-you-mind" target="_blank">getting in on the act</a>, with a responsive design review slowly rolling out overÂ the year.</p>
<div id="attachment_2783" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-2783" src="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wordpress-2015.png" alt="WordPress 2015 Theme" width="800" height="581" srcset="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wordpress-2015.png 899w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wordpress-2015-300x218.png 300w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wordpress-2015-705x512.png 705w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wordpress-2015-450x327.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The WordPress &#8216;2015&#8217; default theme.</p></div>
<p>In the world of WordPress, <a href="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2014/12/10/twenty-fifteen/" target="_blank">Twenty Fifteen</a> set the mobile-first tone for theme developers worldwide, and it&#8217;s increasingly rare to come across new themes that aren&#8217;t responsive by default.</p>
<h2>Flat Is the New Flat</h2>
<p>One pattern repeats itself over and over in the history of online design: Every couple of years, Apple will unveil a <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/whats-new/" target="_blank">fresh look</a> for some or all of their products and â as night follows day â the worldwide design community will scramble to <a href="https://webdesignledger.com/apple-dictates-the-worlds-visual-design" target="_blank">adjust their own sensibilities</a>.</p>
<p>With theÂ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT_OmTMwvZI" target="_blank">launch of iOS7</a> two years ago, that trend was <a href="http://thenextweb.com/dd/2014/03/19/history-flat-design-efficiency-minimalism-made-digital-world-flat/" target="_blank">flat design</a>. In this instance though, Microsoft have arguably got there first with their work on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(design_language)" target="_blank">Metro design language</a>.</p>
<p>Google have taken the movement a <a href="https://www.google.com/design/" target="_blank">substantial step further</a> of late with their ongoing work on the <a href="https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html" target="_blank">Material Design</a> project.</p>
<div class='avia-iframe-wrap'><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrT6v5sOwJg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>With some of the largest companies in the world on board,Â flat design remains a dominant trend in 2015 and shows no signs of disappearing, though its use is <a href="http://thenextweb.com/dd/2015/07/09/the-future-of-flat-design/" target="_blank">increasingly nuanced</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_2776" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.qooqee.com/humanhubris/" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-2776" src="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/human-hubris.png" alt="Human hubris" width="800" height="580" srcset="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/human-hubris.png 1082w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/human-hubris-300x217.png 300w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/human-hubris-1030x746.png 1030w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/human-hubris-705x511.png 705w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/human-hubris-450x326.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Human Hubris Project.</p></div>
<p>Flat design is an excellent solution for smaller devices, and increasing <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=svg" target="_blank">browser support</a> forÂ <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/11/styling-and-animating-svgs-with-css/" target="_blank">SVG graphics</a> is another plus point for its ongoing usage.</p>
<div id="attachment_2793" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://kriesi.at/themes/enfold-business-flat/" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-2793" src="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/enfold-business-flat.png" alt="Enfold Business Flat" width="800" height="690" srcset="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/enfold-business-flat.png 870w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/enfold-business-flat-300x259.png 300w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/enfold-business-flat-705x608.png 705w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/enfold-business-flat-450x388.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Enfold Business Flat theme variation.</p></div>
<p>WordPress theme designers have of course not been slow to respond to this trend and ourÂ own <a href="https://kriesi.at/themes/enfold-business-flat/" target="_blank">Enfold Business Flat</a>Â theme variation is an excellent example of a multi-purpose, modern implementation.</p>
<h2>Farewell Sweet Fold</h2>
<p>Readers of a certain vintage may recall the glory days of <a href="https://www.nuvonium.com/blog/view/stop-the-above-the-fold-web-design-insanity-people-scroll-today" target="_blank">the fold</a>Â âÂ a timeÂ when 1024 x 768 px screen resolutions were considered displays of ostentatious luxury, and Java applets roamed the earth.</p>
<p>In 2015 it&#8217;s very tempting to say that <a href="https://medium.com/@mcjohnson/the-fold-is-dead-d5d040eb012d" target="_blank">the fold is officially dead</a>.</p>
<p>There are <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/page-fold-manifesto/" target="_blank">holdouts</a>Â to this view of course, but â beyond the screamingly obvious fact that what comes at the top of any page will carry more visual significance â it&#8217;s hard to argue that the fold is particularly relevant in a multi-device world.</p>
<p>Scrolling is increasingly touted as <a href="http://speakagency.com/people-scroll-they-want-to-scroll-so-let-them/" target="_blank">the new clicking</a> and the continued popularity of <a href="https://kriesi.at/themes/enfold-restaurant-one-page/" target="_blank">one-page themes</a> bears witness to the fact that users have no problem at all diving below the line.</p>
<h2>Simple and Fast</h2>
<p>Hand-in-hand with several of the trends we&#8217;ve highlighted so far, the twin themes of simplicity and speed have also come to the fore in 2015.</p>
<p>Google have been tracking site speed for the better part of <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-now-counts-site-speed-as-ranking-factor-39708" target="_blank">five years</a>, and the prevalence of mobile devices these days has put a renewed focus on performance as a design concern.</p>
<p>Whether in the form of <a href="http://designmodo.com/hidden-menus/" target="_blank">hidden menus</a>Â for maximum efficiency on smaller devices, or an increasingly confident use of negative space, web designers are embracing constraints and putting the emphasis on simple and bold choices.</p>
<p>One notable consequence of this â enabled by theÂ <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/typography/free-web-fonts-1131610" target="_blank">availability</a>Â of web fonts and <a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-lazy-persons-guide-to-responsive-typography--cms-22822" target="_blank">responsive typography</a> â has been the increasing primacy of text. Large, bold text choices are a trend that came to the fore in 2014 and has continued on into 2015.</p>
<div id="attachment_2784" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://newwavecompany.co/" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-2784" src="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-wave-company.png" alt="The New Wave Company" width="800" height="615" srcset="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-wave-company.png 930w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-wave-company-300x231.png 300w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-wave-company-705x542.png 705w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-wave-company-450x346.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The New Wave Company</p></div>
<p>With a renewed focus on text, there has also been a <a href="http://www.roundpeg.biz/2015/01/sidebar-web-design-tips/" target="_blank">continued questioning</a> of the relevance of design elements such as sidebars. The power of one-column implementations â such as Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone-6/" target="_blank">iPhone 6 page</a>Â âshow just how effective this can be.</p>
<h2>Things Are on the Move Again</h2>
<p>A resurgence in kinetic design has also been evident in 2015. It&#8217;s no secret that both <a href="http://www.reelseo.com/youtube-mobile-increase-watch-time/" target="_blank">users and marketers</a>Â are deeply in love with video content, so its increased use should come as no surprise.</p>
<p>The use of video backgrounds â first started in 2013 â has <a href="http://marketblog.envato.com/inspirations/video-backgrounds-web-design/" target="_blank">continued to rise</a> and, though there&#8217;s a price to be paid in terms of bandwidth and potential distraction, there&#8217;s no doubting the impact video has on users.</p>
<p>Animation, after a rough couple of years disentangling itself from associations with Flash, has also made a return in the form of subtle UI <a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/transitions-animations/" target="_blank">transitions and animations</a>.Â Animated design cues that users are familiar with from the world of apps are now becoming very much <a href="http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2015/05/the-ultimate-guide-to-web-animation/" target="_blank">part of the <em>lingua franca</em></a> of the web.</p>
<p>As always, you can have too much of a good thing in this department but 2015 has seen some great implementations.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2789" src="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/animation-apple-menu.gif" alt="Apple Menu Animation" width="800" height="182" /></p>
<p>Nathan Huening over at <a href="http://www.newmediacampaigns.com/" target="_blank">New Media Campaigns</a> has put together an <a href="http://www.newmediacampaigns.com/blog/examples-of-animation-in-web-design" target="_blank">excellent roundup of contemporary examples</a>, including the <a href="http://www.apple.com/" target="_blank">Apple.com</a> navigation example above.</p>
<h2>Magazine Standards Are Finally Being Met</h2>
<p>Much has been made online of how the web has been relentlessly surpassing various forms of traditional media over the last decade. However, the truth in terms of visual design â until very recently â was that it still lagged quite far behind.</p>
<p>Attracted by the web&#8217;s power, ubiquity and potential, users were prepared to accept standards of graphic designÂ and typography they would have found laughable in a traditional offline publishing context.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a good case to be made that 2015 is the year those standards are finally being met.</p>
<p>The rise of <a href="http://www.narga.net/making-a-wordpress-site-compatible-to-retina-display-what-how-more/" target="_blank">retina-enabled devices</a> and web fonts â along with increased browser sophistication and dramatically improved standards of both custom and stock imagery â mean the web is an increasingly mature design environment.</p>
<div id="attachment_2807" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-2807" src="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/bellroy.jpg" alt="bellroy" width="800" height="375" srcset="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/bellroy.jpg 1600w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/bellroy-300x141.jpg 300w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/bellroy-1030x483.jpg 1030w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/bellroy-1500x703.jpg 1500w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/bellroy-705x330.jpg 705w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/bellroy-450x211.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Slick eCommerce design from Bellroy</p></div>
<p>Evidence for this is everywhere you look, whether in the case of slick eCommerce sites such as <a href="http://bellroy.com/live-life-outside" target="_blank">Bellroy</a>, historical projects such as <a href="http://warsawrising.eu/" target="_blank">Warsaw Rising</a>, or agency sites such as <a href="http://www.impossible-bureau.com/studio" target="_blank">The Impossible Bureau</a>.</p>
<h2>JavaScript Continues to Eat the World</h2>
<p>The technology powering a huge number of the design trends mentioned above is of course JavaScript. The ongoing maturation of frameworks such as <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">Angular</a> and <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank">React</a> is enabling many of the more progressive design trends that are emerging.</p>
<p>The potential downsides of JavaScript in terms of design and user experience have also started to be <a href="http://www.mondaynote.com/2015/07/13/news-sites-are-fatter-and-slower-than-ever/" target="_blank">seriously discussed</a> in 2015.Â <a href="http://blog.lmorchard.com/2015/07/22/the-verge-web-sucks/" target="_blank">Analyses of advertising-fuelled page bloat</a> on sites such as <a href="http://www.theverge.com/" target="_blank">The Verge</a>Â show the potential dark side of JavaScript&#8217;s ubiquity.</p>
<p>For WordPress theme developers, the biggest JavaScript related change is yet to come. The impending full-scale arrival of the <a href="http://wp-api.org/" target="_blank">REST API</a> will signal the official technical uncoupling of the theming layer.</p>
<p>Expect to see a wave of JavaScript-led design solutions emerging in this space and a trend towards increasing &#8216;appification&#8217;. Initial experiments such as Automattic&#8217;s <a href="http://themeshaper.com/2015/05/07/theming-with-the-rest-api-meet-picard/" target="_blank">Picard</a>Â theme and Yoren Chang&#8217;s <a href="https://1fix.io/angularjs-wp-rest-api/" target="_blank">Angular explorations</a>Â show the direction weÂ may be heading in.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s a greatÂ time to be a WordPress theme developer.Â Browser wars are largely a thing of the past, the platform itself is increasingly dominant, and integration with the wider web is just around the corner via the REST API.</p>
<p>The design trends of 2015 that we&#8217;ve covered above put users first, and are refreshingly focused on simplicity and ease of use.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s recap them briefly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Responsive is here to stay.</li>
<li>Flat design remains an ideal mobile-first solution.</li>
<li>Nothing beats simple and fast.</li>
<li>Kinetic design is making a comeback.</li>
<li>Magazine standards are being met.</li>
<li>JavaScript continues to drive design innovation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts on design trends so far in 2015 â what has caught your eye and what you think is coming down the line.Â We also welcomeÂ feedback on our recentÂ releases in the context of design.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="av-intro-text">Updating WordPress Themes is easy, but if you are new to themeforest and/or WordPress here is a guide to help you</p>
<p>In 2015, quickly putting together a professional looking WordPress site that displays perfectly across all devices has never been easier.Â The days of needing a team of eye-wateringly expensive external developers to fine-tune your site for weeks â if not months â are now thankfully in the past.</p>
<p>Here at Kriesi we&#8217;re proud to have played our part in this by releasing a suite of easily configurable, fully responsive themes, chief among them our flagship productÂ <a href="https://kriesi.at/themedemo/?theme=enfold" target="_blank">Enfold</a>.Â But one major paint point weâve seen come up repeatedly â particularly for less experienced WordPress users â is the subject of updating.</p>
<p>Enfold ships with a lifetime guarantee of free updates, and in this article we&#8217;ll walk through everything you need to know to update safely and with confidence for many years to come.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s begin with a quick look at the major versions of the theme to date for some context.</p>
<p><span id="more-2520"></span></p>
<h2>Enfold Versions to Date</h2>
<p>Enfold has been on offer since April 2013 and we&#8217;ve been through three milestone versions and a host of minor releases in that time:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enfold 1.0:</strong> Enfold&#8217;s debut appearanceÂ back in April of 2013.</li>
<li><strong>Enfold 2.0:</strong> The addition of update options direct from the WordPress backend was the standout feature of this August 2013 release.</li>
<li><strong>Enfold 3.0:</strong> A major upgrade of the theme in October 2014 that included demo installs, speed improvements and <a href="https://kriesi.at/archives/enfold-version-3-0-bigger-better-faster" target="_blank">host of new functionality</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The version at the time of writing isÂ <a href="https://kriesi.at/archives/enfold-version-3-1-new-elements-demos-and-long-awaited-improvements" target="_blank">Enfold 3.1</a>.Â One of the mainÂ reasons we&#8217;re mentioning the previous iterations at the top of this article is to draw your attention to a useful file that ships with every version of Enfold:Â <em>version.txt</em>.</p>
<p>If you pop open the main Enfold download folder you should see <em>version.txt</em> sitting at the top level.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2523 size-full" src="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/version-txt-file.png" alt="Enfold version.txt file" width="664" height="103" srcset="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/version-txt-file.png 664w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/version-txt-file-300x47.png 300w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/version-txt-file-450x70.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px" /></p>
<p>Open the fileÂ in a text editor and you&#8217;ll see a complete changelog stretching all the way back to version 1.0.</p>
<p>The details of historic versions will probably be of little interest to anyone other thanÂ developers, but reviewing this file is an excellent way of getting a comprehensive, no-fluff overview of all changes prior to installing a new version.</p>
<p>Before we go any further, let&#8217;s discuss the essential preparatory step to take first to ensureÂ your update process is hassle-free and non-destructive: using child themes.</p>
<h2>What Child Themes Are (And Why You Should Use Them)</h2>
<p>One of the main causes of anxiety when updating a theme is the prospect of losing any customizations you&#8217;ve previously made to your site.</p>
<p>Responsible theme developers go to great pains to make sure their updates are as unobtrusiveÂ as possible, but there is also an onus on you as the site owner to play your part by following best practices forÂ making theme-level modifications.</p>
<p>The recommended technique for modifying your theme in WordPress is via the use of a <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes" target="_blank">child theme</a>. This is simply a separate theme that inherits the parent theme&#8217;s functionality and gives you an encapsulated space to store your own modifications.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress Codex</a> provides an excellent overview for those new to this topic, including a comprehensive section onÂ <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes#How_to_Create_a_Child_Theme" target="_blank">how to create a child theme</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also provided a dedicated section in our online documentation on <a href="https://kriesi.at/documentation/enfold/using-a-child-theme/" target="_blank">Using aÂ ChildÂ Theme in Enfold</a>Â that includes a video overview of the process and a download link for a <a href="http://bit.ly/enfold-child" target="_blank">pre-built Enfold child theme</a> to get you started:</p>
<div class='avia-iframe-wrap'><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/67221517" width="1500" height="844" frameborder="0" title="Enfold - Create a Child Theme" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>We highly recommend going down the child theme route from the beginning, as it&#8217;s the best way to ensure that any changes you make to your Enfold install will be seamlessly maintained across updates. It also offersÂ several additional advantages in terms of overall code modularity and organization.</p>
<p>Realistically however, not everybody will have pursued this path from the outset. You may have been entirely unaware of the child theme option or inherited a project from somebody who neglected to use one.</p>
<p>In that case, your first course of action before updating should be to make an inventory of previous changes made to the parent theme and port them over to a child theme for testing. <a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-update-a-wordpress-theme-without-losing-customization/" target="_blank">WP Beginner</a> have a solid overview of steps to take in order to do this if you are looking for a procedure to follow.</p>
<h2>Always Back Up Your Current Work Before Updating</h2>
<p>With the caveats about use of child themes out of the way, the next major point to bear in mind before we actually update anything is the importance of <strong>backing up your existing work before going any further</strong>.</p>
<p>On the off chance that something goes wrong, you want the security of knowing you have a complete copy of the last working state of your system â WordPress files and database â prior to the change.</p>
<p>Depending on the peculiarities of your setup, there are any number of ways of actually going about this but for those attempting a manual backup for the first time, plugins such as <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/backupwordpress/" target="_blank">BackUpWordPress</a>Â and <a href="https://ithemes.com/purchase/backupbuddy/" target="_blank">BackupBuddy</a> can be a great help.</p>
<p>The WordPress Codex also has <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Backups" target="_blank">a useful overview</a> of the subject and WPBeginner recently put together a great <a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/7-best-wordpress-backup-plugins-compared-pros-and-cons/" target="_blank">breakdown of backup options</a>Â aimed at beginners.</p>
<p>Whichever option you plump for in the end, make sure adequate backups are in place before you attempt any actual updates.</p>
<p>This applies equally to the case of updating WordPress itself, or any plugins you are using. Ideally you also want these updated prior to tackling your theme.</p>
<h2>How to Update Enfold via the WordPress Backend</h2>
<p>So far we&#8217;ve covered the most important precautionary steps to take prior to updating. It&#8217;s now time to move on to the actual update process.</p>
<p>The first option forÂ installing the latest version of Enfold is to do so via the backend of WordPress â an option available in Enfold since version 2.0.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve put together a dedicated <a href="https://kriesi.at/documentation/enfold/updating-your-theme-files/" target="_blank">page on our documentation site</a> covering how to do this in detail, so we&#8217;ll just hitÂ the highlights here.</p>
<p>Begin by entering your <a href="http://themeforest.net/" target="_blank">Themeforest</a> user name and API key in the <em>Enfold Theme Options</em> panel. You can find your API key at Themeforest by navigating to <em>My Settings</em> &gt; <em>API keys</em>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2526 size-full" src="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/enfold-update-screen.jpg" alt="Enfold update screen" width="787" height="738" srcset="https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/enfold-update-screen.jpg 787w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/enfold-update-screen-300x281.jpg 300w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/enfold-update-screen-705x661.jpg 705w, https://kriesi.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/enfold-update-screen-450x422.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 787px) 100vw, 787px" /></p>
<p>This establishes a link between your WordPress install and Themeforest that gets WordPress to check for available updates every twelve hours.</p>
<p>If an update is available, you will be prompted to install directly from the <em>Enfold Theme Options</em> screen with a simple click.</p>
<h2>How to Update Enfold via FTP</h2>
<p>The second option for updating Enfold is to do it manually via FTP. There are two basic reasons why you might want to choose this option:</p>
<ol>
<li>You&#8217;ve hit a problem with the backend solution.</li>
<li>You need fine-grained control over exactly what gets overwritten on the server.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you&#8217;re new to the world of FTP, you&#8217;ll need to get your hands on an FTP client to use before going any further.</p>
<p><a href="https://filezilla-project.org/" target="_blank">Filezilla</a> is a reliable, popular and free cross-platform choice. <a href="http://winscp.net/eng/docs/free_ftp_client_for_windows" target="_blank">WinSCP</a> has long been a favorite for Windows users, and many Mac users swear by solutions such as <a href="https://cyberduck.io" target="_blank">Cyberduck</a> and <a href="http://panic.com/transmit/" target="_blank">Transmit</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve put together a video guide to walk you throughÂ updating via FTP:</p>
<div class='avia-iframe-wrap'><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/67209750" width="1500" height="844" frameborder="0" title="Update with FTP" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>The video outlines an easy to follow, five-step process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the latest version of Enfold from your Themeforest account.</li>
<li>Check the details of the new version in the file <em>version.txt</em> we mentioned at the top of the article. This will detail which files have been changed.</li>
<li>Unzip the <em>enfold.zip</em> file locally so you have access to the update files for uploading.</li>
<li>Connect to your site via FTP and navigate to the location of your Enfold install in <em>/wp-content/themes</em>.</li>
<li>Replace the contents of your live theme folder with the updated version.</li>
</ol>
<p>The video also outlines strategies for dealing with situations where you have initial customizations outside a child theme that you wish to preserve.</p>
<h2>Further Resources</h2>
<p>The information above should be enough to get you safely through the majority of updates but â computers and software being what they are â there will be times you&#8217;ll need some extra information or assistance regardless of your level of expertise.</p>
<p>Your first port of call should be the <a href="https://kriesi.at/documentation/enfold/" target="_blank">Enfold documentation</a> itself. We&#8217;re constantly striving to make this resource as comprehensive as possible and if there&#8217;s an answer you can&#8217;t find in there, we encourage you to contact us about it â your feedback is a vital part of making the documentation better for every user.</p>
<p>Enfold, likeÂ all other Kriesi themes, also comes with a guarantee of lifelong customer support. Take advantage of this when you are struggling and feel free to contact us with any questions or comments via the <a href="https://kriesi.at/support/forum/enfold/" target="_blank">Enfold support forum</a>.</p>
<p>For each release, there will generally be a <a href="https://kriesi.at/support/topic/enfold-3-0-update-thread/" target="_blank">dedicated thread covering common update issues</a> that is actively monitored by Kriesi staff â in addition to individual posts regarding update problems. We do our best to respond as quickly as possible to every thread on the support forum.</p>
<p>WordPress itself is a constantly evolving platform so it&#8217;s also obviously worth investing some time in keeping up to speed on the application itself.</p>
<p>Newer WordPress users should take the time to review the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress Codex</a>Â as many common questions are dealt with there in depth. Of particular note is theÂ <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Lessons" target="_blank">WordPressÂ Lessons</a> section within the online documentation that offers an excellently organized learning path to follow.</p>
<p>There are also a number of excellent resources for deepening yourÂ WordPress knowledge available for free at sites such as <a href="http://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/35-resources-for-kick-ass-wordpress-developers" target="_blank">WPMU DEV</a> and <a href="http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/learn-wordpress-2015/" target="_blank">Hongkiat</a>Â along with paid courses from platforms such as <a href="http://www.lynda.com/WordPress-training-tutorials/330-0.html" target="_blank">Lynda</a>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We hope this articleÂ has taken some of the fear out of updating your copy of Enfold. Let&#8217;s briefly recap the steps we covered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get familiar with what has changed in the latest update by reviewing the contents of <em>version.txt</em>.</li>
<li>Try to make sure you&#8217;re using a child theme if at all possible.</li>
<li>Make sure WordPress and your plugins are up to date and that you have a full backup of your system in place.</li>
<li>Either run through the backend install option to update or proceed manually via FTP if you need more control.</li>
<li>Check the documentation and don&#8217;t be afraid to contact support if you run into any difficulties along the way.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Please let us know if you think we&#8217;ve missed out on any common issues that trip up Enfold users, or if you have any suggestions for making the update process easier in future releases in the comments below.</strong></p>
<p>We look forward to hearing from you!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="av-intro-text">As a web developer you get that question quite often. My usual answer: what should a car cost?Â As with most things in life it depends&#8230;</p>
<p>Back in the halcyon days of the early web, developers were free to pluck pretty much <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2012/11/my-first-customer-is-now-dead/" target="_blank">whatever crazy price occurred to them</a> out of the air and present it to their clients.</p>
<p>These days â Â particularly at the entry level â pricing is becoming increasingly commodified and pressure is very much in the downward direction.</p>
<p>Working out how much you should be paying for a website remains a pain point for many small businesses though, as does finding someone reliable to build it for you in WordPress.</p>
<p>In this article we&#8217;ll tackle the question of how much a WordPress website should really cost, and what you need to know about pricing as a site owner to make sure you aren&#8217;tÂ paying over the odds.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with why you should pay someone to do this in the first place.</p>
<p><span id="more-2477"></span></p>
<h2>Why You Need a Developer</h2>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, we&#8217;re going to use the term &#8220;developer&#8221; throughout this article but you will probably be dealing with a hybrid designer/developer â or a small group of freelancers â if you are putting together a small site.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re also assuming that on a smaller projectÂ you won&#8217;t be dealing withÂ agencies. There are some links to point you in the right direction in this regard towards the end of the piece.</p>
<p>The ease of installing and configuring a basic WordPress site these days might even lead many business owners to consider having a crack at doing the work themselves, particularly if they are coming from a technical background.</p>
<p>The question you have to ask yourself from the outset is â what is the most constructive use of your time?</p>
<p>Unless you&#8217;re in the happy position of having an existing, flawlessly set up business ticking away in the background and lots of time to kill, you&#8217;re probably better off hiring someone else to do this.</p>
<p>There are two obvious reasons why.</p>
<ol>
<li>Firstly, you&#8217;re getting an expert in to do a job that requires genuine expertise. WordPress is simple to use until it all of a sudden isn&#8217;t and â as with any other pieces of software â seemingly minor snags can easily mushroom into days of lost productivity if you&#8217;re not 100% sure what you&#8217;re doing.</li>
<li>Secondly, employing an outsider frees up your time and mental space for properly planning and managing the overall build. It&#8217;s extremely taxing â even for those with a development background â to be both the project planner and the one responsible for its implementation. A clear separation of concerns significantly increases the chances of a satisfactory outcome.</li>
</ol>
<p>We also advise, if you do decide to bite the bullet and hire externally, that you do yourself a favor and go for an actual professional.</p>
<p>The classic mistake first time site owners make is in hiring a &#8220;friend of a friend&#8221; who &#8220;knows about websites&#8221; or <a href="http://www.tracepoint.co.uk/blog/why-you-shouldn-t-hire-your-cousin-twice-removed-for-your-B2B-marketing" target="_blank">a family member</a> looking to get into the game. Nine times out of ten, this is a recipe for disaster and bad blood all round.</p>
<p>Make sure you&#8217;re only considering full-time developers with a strong portfolio of existing client work from the outset.</p>
<h2>Finding a Developer</h2>
<p>After you&#8217;ve established that you&#8217;re prepared to actually pay someone to make your WordPress site for you, the next natural question is where to start looking for this person.</p>
<p>Before your search begins, save all future parties a lot of time and energy by taking your best shot at defining the actual scope of work to be done.</p>
<p>A good freelancer will obviously be happy to go through the requirements and help define the final scope of the project with you but it&#8217;s enormously helpful for all concerned to have some sort of starting point to kick things off.</p>
<p>Put together a sensible summaryÂ of your existing content and resources, start at least thinking about your budget and timeframes, clearly articulate the main problem the site should be solving, and list any special requirements.</p>
<p>With something committed to paper, you&#8217;re off to the races.Â Here are three general places you can productively start your search:</p>
<h3>1. Word of Mouth Recommendations</h3>
<p>Hiring friends or family may be a bad idea but looking for recommendations from your business peers is an excellent one. Put the word out to your network that you&#8217;re in the market for expert WordPress assistance and follow up on any leads you receive.</p>
<h3>2. Other Sites in Your Space</h3>
<p>Part of the prep work you should do before even looking for a developer will obviously involve reviewing competitor sites and those related to your field, to get a feel for the standards you&#8217;ll need to match in terms of content and presentation.</p>
<p>As you do this, make a note of any sites that particularly stand out for the excellence of their execution and see if a little googling can turn up who was responsible for putting them together.</p>
<h3>3. Online Job Portals</h3>
<p>Assuming you have your own organizational house in order and are dealing with an experienced service provider, there&#8217;s really very little reason you need to be in the same physical location as whoever is working on your site.</p>
<p>Elance and oDesk (recently merged under the <a href="https://www.upwork.com" target="_blank">Upwork</a> moniker) have long been the first port of call for business owners looking for remote assistance. <a href="https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/browse/?q=wordpress" target="_blank">WordPress is a huge category</a> on the jobs portal with thousands of providers bidding for work.</p>
<p>Chris Lema has a good overview on <a href="http://chrislema.com/where-to-find-wordpress-developers/" target="_blank">other generalist providers</a> that&#8217;s worth a quick read to get you oriented.</p>
<p>A new breed of WordPress-specific job portals are also springing up these days. Sites such as <a href="http://www.wphired.com/" target="_blank">WP Hired</a>, <a href="https://codeable.io/" target="_blank">Codeable</a>, <a href="http://studio.envato.com/" target="_blank">Envato Studio</a>Â are all excellent resources. WooThemes <a href="http://www.woothemes.com/affiliated-woo-workers/" target="_blank">Affiliated Woo Workers</a> is also worth a browse.</p>
<h2>What Goes into Putting Together a Site</h2>
<p>Specific use cases such as standard brochure sites and small eCommerce sites are essentially solved design problems in 2015, and should be priced accordingly (we&#8217;ll get on to that in a minute).</p>
<p>However as a site owner for possibly the first time, you should be aware that there is a lot more to setting up a site than the end product you see on the page.Â The following elements will all be factored into a well thought out estimate:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Initial project planning:</strong> All initial communication, quotations, mock-up designs etc.</li>
<li><strong>Site build and revision rounds:</strong> Ideally you want to avoid the perils of the Big Reveal and work iteratively with your developer through successive rounds of revisions including user and client testing.</li>
<li><strong>Hosting:</strong> Your site needs somewhere to live. And though the hosting costs themselves may be fairly minimal for most small sites, someone still has to do the heavy lifting in terms of getting them set up.</li>
<li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> You may or may not be quoted for ongoing maintenance, updates and minor fixes of the site. Clarify how this will be handled at the outset. Services such as <a href="http://wpcurve.com/" target="_blank">WP Curve</a> can provide an excellent low-cost, long-term solution for this problem.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Developers Arrive At TheirÂ Rates</h2>
<p>There are two basic ways you may be charged for work done in getting your WordPress site set up: <a href="http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2010/10/charging-per-hour-vs-per-project/" target="_blank">hourly or by the project</a>.</p>
<p>The subject of which to choose is a <a href="http://chrislema.com/why-i-never-charge-hourly-for-wordpress-work/" target="_blank">hotly debated</a> one, but it&#8217;s worth noting two things about the prices you&#8217;ll see quoted:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pricing isÂ <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/09/21/ramit-sethi-and-patrick-mckenzie-on-why-your-customers-would-be-happier-if-you-charged-more/" target="_blank">ultimately arbitrary</a>. There is no one true scale of rates that everyone agrees on or is bound by.</li>
<li>PricesÂ quoted have to factor in <a href="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/calculate-hourly-freelance-rates-web-design-development-work" target="_blank">a considerable number of items</a> above and beyond the specifics of the project.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, with those points in mind, what are some typical numbers for WordPress work?</p>
<p>The last official large-scale survey of the WordPress developer community was performed in 2011 and publicized in <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/photomatt/wordpress-state-of-the-word-2012" target="_blank">2012&#8217;s State of the Word</a> review.</p>
<p>Siobhan McKeown provided <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/04/12/wordpress-economy-part-1/" target="_blank">a solid summary</a> of the pricing takeaways at the time, with the median hourly rate being $50. Bear in mind, that figure covers a potentially massive range of different types of work.</p>
<p>In March of 2015, Brian Krogsgard put together an excellent outline of illustrative rates for site development in his pieceÂ <a href="https://poststatus.com/wordpress-website-cost/" target="_blank">How much should a custom WordPress website cost?</a></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve picked out the highlight rates below:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Freelancer rates</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Beginner freelancer: $25-$40 per hour</li>
<li>Intermediate freelancer: $40-75 per hour</li>
<li>Good, experienced freelancer: $75 â $125 per hour</li>
<li>Excellent, in demand freelancer: $125 â $175 per hour</li>
<li>Specialist, best in industry: $175 â $400 per hour</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on personal experience and conversations with industry insiders, I&#8217;d say those rates are pretty representative.</p>
<p>As you can see, there&#8217;s a fairly hefty variance in terms of pricing. If you&#8217;re looking to hire Mark Jaquith, it&#8217;s going to cost you <a href="http://coveredwebservices.com/rates/" target="_blank">$350 an hour</a>. If you&#8217;re hiring a relatively <a href="http://bradymower.com/rates-as-a-wordpresser-and-web-designer/" target="_blank">freshly-minted developer</a>, $25 per hour would be much more normal.</p>
<p>As with most other things in life, you will get what you pay for, so looking for <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/206faf/til_when_reporters_asked_astronaut_alan_shepard/" target="_blank">the cheapest bid</a> is almost certainly not a great idea.</p>
<h2>What a Typical Site Should Cost</h2>
<p>Giving estimates for development work of any kind is a <a href="http://chrislema.com/the-art-of-giving-an-estimate/" target="_blank">notoriously tricky business</a>. You also have to bear in mind that there are a large variety of different types of sites that could be built.</p>
<p>Krogsgard breaks out an eminently sensible set of nine different optionsÂ <a href="https://poststatus.com/wordpress-website-cost/" target="_blank">in his article</a>,Â and it&#8217;s questionable whether there is even any such thing as a &#8220;typical site&#8221; these days.</p>
<p>All that said, there are two broad classes of sites whose creation tends to be relatively standardized and priced on an almost product level: business brochure sites and small eCommerce sites.</p>
<h3>Brochure Sites</h3>
<p>As far back as 2011, Chris Pearson was making a decent case for small brochure sites to be starting at the $1800 range. In 2015, Krogsgard pegs it at around the $3000 mark. Meanwhile, a range of <a href="https://www.webcreationuk.co.uk/business-plus/" target="_blank">package solutions</a> are available online starting at around the $500 price point.</p>
<p>That spread fromÂ $500 to $3000 is the difference between something built entirely off the shelf using pre-built themes and minimum customization, and a solution tailored to your needs that might require significant design input.</p>
<p>For a professionally put together small brochure site that involves working closely with the developer, you should be expecting to pay <a href="http://www.artofblog.com/do-most-wordpress-developers-charge-too-much/" target="_blank">north of $2000</a>.</p>
<h3>eCommerce Sites</h3>
<p>Solutions such as <a href="http://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/" target="_blank">WooCommerce</a> have significantly simplified the creation of eCommerce websites in WordPress but it remains a site category with a lot of potential pitfalls.</p>
<p>There may be complex product feeds to integrate, multi-language considerations and custom checkouts required. That&#8217;s before you get into any of the complexities of fulfilment or international shipping and tax rates.</p>
<p>WooCommerce&#8217;s own breakdown of the typical fixed costs involved comes in at <a href="http://prospress.com/cost-of-setting-up-an-online-store/" target="_blank">a generous $89.40</a>, but that&#8217;s conveniently assuming you perform all the work yourself and don&#8217;t count your time as an expense.</p>
<p>In an excellent post by Chris Lema on <a href="http://www.woothemes.com/2013/09/why-we-often-price-e-commerce-projects-wrong/" target="_blank">the difficulty of eCommerce website pricing</a> he mentions one very useful rule of thumb:</p>
<blockquote><p>Did you know that on average, of over 150 online retailers studied by Forrester, the cost of supporting their eCommerce systems was 7% of their online revenues.</p>
<p>Now there was a wide range, from 3% to 10%, but think about it. If a company generates $1 million from its eCommerce platform, it should expect to spend at least $30,000 in a year â to keep it well-tuned.</p></blockquote>
<p>The good folks over at Commerce Gurus <a href="http://www.commercegurus.com/2015/01/25/much-ecommerce-website-cost/" target="_blank">dove even further into the issue</a> with a detailed breakdown of all the stages an eCommerce site can go through, and arrived at a minimum outlay of $10,000 to get the ball rolling.</p>
<p>Based on experience, that figure seems a touch high to me, but it&#8217;s by no means extortionate. Expect to be spending a minimum of $5,000 to get up and running in this department.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We hope the article has shed at least a little light on the subject of what you should be expecting to pay for your site. All sites are of course different and your mileage will vary, but start-up costs of $2000-$5000 are not unusual.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that the purpose of virtually any site is to become a significant profit center in its own right. It&#8217;s worth spending real money to get this essential part of your business right straight out of the gate.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re curious to hear of your own experience in this area. Think the figures quoted are way too high? Or should the starting points be even steeper for really top quality work? <strong>Share your opinion with us in the comments below.</strong></p>
