		<description><![CDATA[Very nice updates for performance!! I ran a gtmetrix.com report on the website before I made any updates and then ran the report again after I updated the theme and implemented some of the new features and watched the scores get better with every change! Very nicely done, the hard work put in to this really shows!!&#039;

Thanks for the big update!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It would be great if you had a tutorial of some sort on when to implement these features.  I tried them out and it made things worse and not only that it caused some of web pages to render improperly.  It would also be great to some sort of visual to go with each element or an indicator to let us know if it is actually being used in the site. Then we know what to turn off.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alright. Slightly reworded it but the general information still holds true. Google announced the following in January: 

&quot;Today we’re announcing that starting in July 2018, page speed will be a ranking factor for mobile searches.&quot; 

And the scores/grades graphic is a teaser for the next blog post, were we also mention that 100/100 is not exactly necessary and often comes with drawbacks and is also only an indicator for good performance, but to get the readers attention I think its fair to post such a picture ;)

I think among the competition we are still among those who really try not to over exaggerate for marketing purposes, but we still need to do a little bit of marketing, so don&#039;t judge us too hard :D]]></description>
