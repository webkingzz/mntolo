		<description><![CDATA[I just wanted to congratulate the developers on an amazing update .... recent mobile and now speed updates is AWESOME.

The idea of BEFORE YOU POST, KNOWN ISSUS and KNOWN PLUGIN CONFLICTS is great .... I’ve no idea how the moderators can keep up with the forum requests particularly as there is often 1-2 days between replies ... you have to get your head around the issue each time.

**I do wonder if you should consider premium paid support as many people will really Want faster support ... that you’d find easier to resolve because it’s fresh.**

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Rob!

Thanks for your contribution! After our problems with recent updates thats basically the conclusion we came to a well. We will form a group of Beta testers and let them check releases that change anything important. Since 4.4 will bring only smaller changes (mostly data security compliance stuff for the upcoming GDPR and bugfixes) we will probably set up the group afterwards. I would love to have you on board for this and will gladly notify you once we get beta testing going :)

I will also forward your post  to Yigit, who is basically in charge of the forum and I also think he will like your sticky ideas.

Truth to be told, I dont think Accurit was saying fix bugs first then optimize, (which is something I can work with and an argument I do understand) The post is more like: this is all wrong and your theme should not do that. As one can hopefully see I do appreciate constructive feedback and criticism, and if there are ideas for improvements and solutions I am all ears :) What he basically did was calling me a liar and that the results in the optimisation post above are made up. Probably the worst way to start a honest discussion about a piece of software with a developer :P

Anyways, thanks for the feedback, I do appreciate it. 
Cheers!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually I love the &quot;rant&quot;. It provides some very constructive feedback on what you want to see and I think you got a very good point here. I will incorporate the &quot;consistency efforts&quot; into our current development cycle. I am not sure how fast we will be able to normalize all of that stuff across all the template builder elements but you can be sure that you were heard and that over the next few releases we will honor this request. I was thinking about this for some time now but I always figured that its a nice to have and nothing anyone really cared about. Good to know that I underestimated that &quot;feature&quot;.

Thanks for the feedback ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I also agree with much of what accurIT Presence said. While I appreciate the optimizations of the theme, I am continually frustrated that each update since the middle of last year breaks basic functions of the theme that must then be patched in the forums until developers can fix. I used to just live update Enfold on my production site, now no way would I do that -- the updates are just too buggy. The auto play on the old sliders has been an issue since last fall -- maybe a solution is to deprecate those sliders and roll out new sliders that don&#039;t have such an issue handling video? These bugs are not specific environment specific but impact all or most users and they are not all &quot;wrong PHP versions.&quot;

The forum has a lot of mods working hard to answer the same questions over and over because (a) documentation is outdated and (b) stickys on the forum are not updated / complete. You are paying the mods to answer the same questions over and over again... for example every mod now asks PHP version with almost every problem since that&#039;s the root of many issues.

There should be stickies on the forum that are READ ONLY so they don&#039;t become problem / answer threads like they do now:
1. KNOWN ISSUES WITH ENFOLD X.X (current release). (frustrating to see the same question asked right now about the LayserSlider shortcode not working on the current Enfold release as an example, and it consumes mod resources that could be better used elsewhere)
2. BEFORE YOU POST (have you disabled all plugins? are you running PHP x.x version or above? have you updated to latest version of the theme?
3. ENFOLD REQUIREMENTS (again php version, wordpress version, etc)
4. KNOWN PLUGIN INCOMPATIBILITIES 

I&#039;m sure I am forgetting one or two but you get the idea.

Also, why not run a group of Beta testers with more complex sites (like mine) who test the theme updates on staging servers with various configurations and provide feedback? I am sure you test the updates, but there&#039;s no way you can test them with many different configurations and server environments -- but your Beta team can. I would be happy to do this for you guys in the interest of stabilizing the releases.

I think the point Accurit was making was fix bugs first, stabilize, THEN optimize. I am still running 4.2.3. because that&#039;s the last version that works well with my site. Huge props to Yigit for working to help me get to 4.3.1 but the video issues (again) were the final thing that caused me to stick with 4.2.3 until 4.3.2 (I hope) sorts them out, as well as Layerslider etc.

The excellent support is what keeps me with Enfold, but unfortunately I am needing it more and more. And I don&#039;t feel like there is an air traffic controller right now managing the forum (stickies, making sure FIFO, etc) and I see many planes circling in trouble.

We are all fans, otherwise we would not take the time to type up constructive suggestions. Please take them in that vein and take action.

Thanks Kriesi!

		<description><![CDATA[I concur with some of accurIT Presence comments and I understand the frustration.  I too am a long time fan of your work Kriesi and the team behind you, but I feel frustrated too.

I only have about 20 licences of Enfold, so I don&#039;t consider myself a significant customer by any means.  However, I would have 50 licences by now if it didn&#039;t take me so long to build my sites as I want them to look.

For me, speed started to become an issue about 12 months ago.  I found my sites running slow, I was getting 500 Internal Server errors and just editing pages took too long.  I could mess around with caching plugins, config settings, image optimisation etc.
Eventually, I moved hosting companies and my site speeds increased by 400%.  In some cases, I can pay to improve speed.

What I can&#039;t pay for, and this is where the frustration lies, is features.  Not necessarily new features, but consistent features and this is the most frustrating thing of all.  Over time, you have introduced various enhancements to certain elements, perhaps the ability to change font size, font colour, background colour, background overlay, fixed height, hide on mobile etc.  BUT, you leave it there.  Instead of making things consistent, I now find myself starting with a particular element only to find something that is enabled for one element is not in the element I am using.  For example, this evening I am working on a slider for a home page.  There is NO option to add a custom colour to a button!  This may sound like a small issue compared to achieving a 100% page speed score but its more important to me and my clients that I get the right colour for my button.  I can select custom colours in other areas so why not in this element too?  Some elements I can even select a transparent colour, but no, not in all.  Why is that?

Why are there different options in the full-screen slider than others?  Why can I not put an overlay on all image type elements? e.g. When using an image in a grid.  Why am I, after all these years, still limited to only a grey background for slider titles, why can I not choose another colour? Why am I forced to make exact image sizes to fit the sliders when you set a slider at 1500x430 as using an image of 1500x640 increases the slider for that image.   There are far too many inconsistencies to mention.

I appreciate you have done work around mobile devices, but I feel more needs to be done, much more.

I see you introduced some kind of new font size but couldn&#039;t find any documentation on how this is supposed to work.  I tried it on one element and got text filling my screen so went back to the normal px sizes.  Again, this font option is not available on all elements, so I forget on which I saw it.  I don&#039;t know if the latest update fixed the mobile issue with your demo timeline element, but it doesn&#039;t work correctly when you reduce screen size, some of the dates do not appear.  (there are 7 in total but minimise the screen and you may only get 3 or 5 as you scroll).

Dialog with your user base would be good.  I hardly ever visit the support forum these days because it is full of questions I was asking 5 or 6 years ago - hence the need for improved documentation / video snippets etc.  When I do visit, I feel my questions are merely a challenge for a programmer to get the best solution for the next five minutes. I get the impression, that nobody actually cares that this is the 110th time this week the same or similar question has been asked - if they did, you would expect new features and improvements to come from support, not from the minority who can be bothered to submit feature requests.  It really must feel like groundhog day in the support dept.  Now, please don&#039;t get me wrong, I am not critizising support. They do an amazing job.  However, to keep answering the same questions doesn&#039;t help anyone long term, and you have acknowledged this is a concern.  It is easy to add options, tick boxes that turn things on and off but everyone is happy dishing out quick css to make temporary fixes.

Sorry for the rant.  If I didn&#039;t care about you guys and the theme, I simply wouldn&#039;t have bothered. I do care and love Enfold.  I appreciate in development cycles you have to stop, re-think, re-code for the future - please continue to do this but stop producing demo themes until you have something different to show - they are all the same and all work terrible on mobile (because you turn half of the content off).   

To pick up on what Olaf said, if you had found a better theme .... well, I now have my eyes well and truly on Elementor.  I am using it with the MyListing Theme (I did email Kriesi over a year ago to build a directory theme lol).  It has some great features (and is consistent), works brilliantly for mobile and although it is strickly a plugin, there are many free themes to sit on top of it.

There are always great comments about the great work you do - and they are well deserved!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi,

I&#039;m one of those repeat clients who have bought Enfold for multiple projects. I already posted a positive message earlier to Kriesi about the 4.3. update and have updated two of my sites to 4.3.1 without a problem. I did pingdom and gtmetrix tests and both showed improved results after the updating to 4.3.1. The original 4.3. had some bugs which the 4.3.1 fixed and I&#039;m sure the Kriesi team is busy fixing some other bugs that may have arisen.

I&#039;ve read through a lot of the Enfold support forum posts and many of the critical errors seem to be because of plugin incompatibility, server settings or user error. 
Some bugs like the infamous Safari fullscreen background video mess did affect me as well but I haven&#039;t had a single crash or whitescreen because of Enfold.

I have tried a couple of other themes (The7, Salient and SiteOrigin Vantage) and they are all perfectly fine.
All have their own kinks and quirks but I still come back to Enfold because it makes my life easier and allows me to achieve my designs easier.

Like Kriesi said you need new customer to keep the lights on and develop the theme and that requires new features to attract new customers. If you want a really barebones rock solid no-features just the basics kind of theme why not go with Sitepress themes. 
Sincerely @accurIT Presence, if you would have found a better theme to work with wouldn&#039;t you have switched years ago?]]></description>

<p>Like Kriesi said you need new customer to keep the lights on and develop the theme and that requires new features to attract new customers. If you want a really barebones rock solid no-features just the basics kind of theme why not go with Sitepress themes.<br />
Sincerely @accurIT Presence, if you would have found a better theme to work with wouldn&#8217;t you have switched years ago?</p>
