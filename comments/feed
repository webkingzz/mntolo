		<description><![CDATA[My website doesn&#039;t work properly anymore since the update to WP 5.0. I can&#039;t change any texts or add new elements. So I tried to upgrade the theme, which says version 3.8 at the moment, but it shows this message: &quot;No Updates available. You are running the latest version!&quot; What should I do??]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have 7 or 8 sites running Enfold and as such have been very nervous as I also provide a managed service to look after these.

The 19th  Dec release of Enfold is running on one of my live sites, without the Classic Editor plugin installed and WP 5.0.2 - so far all the issues I&#039;d previously found (and subsequently had to install the classic editor) seem to be resolved.

I thought I would post this purely for people info - I&#039;m not going to update the other to WP5 for a while as I&#039;m sure other issues will surface - particularly as WP seems to be updating minor releases at a fairly rapid rate - but so far so good with the latest release.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi

My hoster provides PHP 7.3, so I did an upgrade of my website to this PHP version (had PHP 7.2 previously).

The result is the following error message after the backend login:
&quot;No input file specified.&quot;

I guess that Enfold (in my case v4.5.1) is not compatible with PHP 7.3 yet. Is that possible and if yes, when will that be resolved?
(downgraded to PHP 7.2 now to make the backend available again)

Best regards and thanks in advance
